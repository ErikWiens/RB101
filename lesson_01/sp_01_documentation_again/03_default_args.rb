my_method(4, 5, 6)

# https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/Kernel.html#method-i-p
# According to the docs, p is an instance method of the kernel module.

#   "For each object, directly writes obj.inspect followed by a newline to the 
#   programâ€™s standard output."

# We are calling p with a single argument, an array of integers.
# So what does inspect return when it's called on an instance of an array?

# https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/Array.html#method-i-inspect
# inspect creates a string representation by calling inspect on each object

# But how will the 3 arguments be allocated to the 4 parameters?
